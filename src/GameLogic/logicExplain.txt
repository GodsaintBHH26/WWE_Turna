When I initially started making (basically right now 05-04-2025), I just wanted to try something different than the things I usually do and I was inspired by the website - pokemonshowdown.com //

Game Logic -------------------------------------
As I first thought of making this game, there were a few things I considered.
    1. The probability of each move, lesser the damage the higher the probability of that move. (Here, when I talk about probability, I mean the probability of that move landing on the opponent)
    2. The damage dealt by each move. (There are currently 4 moves right now, which will changed in the future where the user will be able to choose 4 moves out of a given menu of 10 moves)
    3. The balance between those moves to keep fair gameplay. (To make sure players don't feel unfair against a certain wrestler, I've decided to keep the damage dealt by wrestler almost same depending on the catagory of that move)
    4. The total hit-points or health aka hp, will be same for each wrestler.



Work Progress ----------------------------------
    ^ The first thing I started working on was the UI as it is natural to work on first. 

    ^ After I made the outer layout of the UI, (basically the viewport & buttons and putting them all-together) I started working on the animation of the characters after using/clicking the certain button. 

    ^ Since it's not an open-world game or any other story-based the game machanics solely focus on the gameplay rather than other in-depth details about the in-game world build. (in terms of world, it's just the background image actually so I guess I'll add those as I progress)

    ^ As for the animations I'm keeping them to minimal for now, especially since it's not one of my strong suits in web dev. So I'll probably use the same animations over and over.

    ^ After I'm done with the basic animation and testing with it, I will be able to proceed with the in-game logic for point evaluation and keeping track of hp & damage.
    -----------------------------------------------------
    ^ Change in plan! I thought that I'd work on the logic once the animation was done taken care of. But it turns out to be a bigger pain in A.. so I'll focus on the game logic for now.
